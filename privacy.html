    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Effective Date: February 3, 2026</p>

    <p>Silvan Library ("we," "our," or "the app") is a Magic: The Gathering collection management and deck building app developed by TrueNorthAI LLC. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in with Apple, we receive a unique user identifier and, optionally, your name and email address (if you choose to share them). Apple's "Hide My Email" feature is fully supported.</p>
    <p><strong>Collection Data:</strong> Card names, quantities, conditions, binder/deck configurations, and associated metadata you enter into the app. This data is stored on your device and synced to our cloud service (Supabase) if you opt in to cloud sync.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage statistics (e.g., feature usage frequency, crash reports) to improve app quality. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>
    <p><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> Subscription purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. RevenueCat, our subscription management provider, receives anonymized purchase receipts to manage your subscription status.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the app's core functionality (collection tracking, deck building, card scanning)</li>
      <li>To sync your collection data across your devices via cloud backup</li>
      <li>To manage your subscription status and entitlements</li>
      <li>To improve app performance and fix bugs</li>
      <li>To fetch real-time card pricing and metadata from third-party APIs (Scryfall)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple Sign In:</strong> Authentication provider. Subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Cloud database and authentication backend. Data is stored securely with encryption at rest.</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Subscription management. Processes anonymized purchase data. Subject to <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Scryfall API:</strong> Card data and pricing. No personal data is shared with Scryfall.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your collection data is stored locally on your device and, if cloud sync is enabled, on Supabase servers (hosted on AWS, US region). All data in transit is encrypted using TLS. Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256.</p>

    <h2>5. Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>The app uses your device camera solely for scanning Magic: The Gathering cards using on-device OCR (optical character recognition). Card images are processed locally on your device and are never uploaded to our servers or any third party.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your data is retained as long as your account is active. You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from the app's Settings screen. Upon deletion, all cloud-synced data is permanently removed within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Silvan Library is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal data we hold about you</li>
      <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your data</li>
      <li>Export your collection data from the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
